## Question ##
1. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message that tells how many years they have to be 100 years old. (For platforms that don’t support user input, just set variables as the user inputted values)

2. Write a program to ask the user a number, then compute if it's odd or even. (For platforms that don’t support user input, just set variables as the user inputted values)

3. Take a list, say for example this one:
a = [1, 1, 2,13, 21, 34, 3, 5, 8, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

4. Take two lists, for example:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between them (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

5. Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not without using any built in reversal methods. (For platforms that don’t support user input, just set variables as the user inputted values)
